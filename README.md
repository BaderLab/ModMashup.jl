This package provides real-time multiple association network integration algorithm for predicting gene function using both mashup and GeneMANIA.

We utilize Mashup algorithm to replace linear regression part of GeneMANIA, which is proved to be extremely computational efficient.

## Usage

#### Installation

```julia
Pkg.rm("ModMashup")
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/memoiry/ModMashup.jl")
```


#### Example

See [Example section](http://memoiry.me/ModMashup.jl/dev/get_start.html) in the documentation for more information about the package usage.

#### Integrate with R `netDX` package

See [GSoC summary and end-to-end example](http://memoiry.me/ModMashup.jl/dev/GSoC.html) for the information to update R `netDX` package with updated ModMashup.jl.

#### API

See [Documentation](https://memoiry.github.io/ModMashup.jl) for more information about API usage.

## Background

Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. Thus, GeneMANIA is proposed, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time.
