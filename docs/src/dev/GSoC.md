## GSoC Project Summary and End-to-End Example

Google Summer of Code 2017 is approaching to its finish line. Time to sum up what has been completed! Check [ModMashup.jl](https://github.com/memoiry/ModMashup.jl) to get all the source code. 


### What?

The goal of the project was to replace GeneMANIA's network integration algorithm with a smaller memory footprint for high-performance computing. And, of course, having a command-line tool that can be integrated into any packages or system. The aim is to reduce the time needed to perform netDX query. Now we can say the project have successfully achieved this goal! (50x faster with promising accuracy)

### How?

We design a novel method to replace linear regression part of GeneMANIA with a network embedding algorithm called Mashup, check [Algorithm details here](http://memoiry.me/ModMashup.jl/dev/contributions.html#Network-integration-1).

The main contribution of ModMashup.

1. Utilize network embedding to infer network weights.
2. Run cross validation in single query with a list of queries file, no more time is needed for re-initialization.
3. Only need similarity networks file and utilize julia's internal functionality to index patients' name to their id while GeneMANIA cost many time to construct Java database.


### Mashup command tool

This project provide a `Command Line Tool` located in [mashup.jl](https://github.com/memoiry/ModMashup.jl/blob/master/tools/mashup.jl), which has two usage.

1. Modified Mashup feature selection.
2. Label propagation for patients ranking.

**Arguments**:

```julia
"command"
  help = "what function do you want to use? ie. selection, ranking"
  arg_type = String
  required = true
"--net"
  help = "Folder name where the similarity network is stored"
  arg_type = String
  required = true
"--id"
  help = "Patients name in the database"
  arg_type = String
  required = true
"--labels"
  help = "If for selection, it should be labels file name. If for ranking, it should be query file name and we use it to label patients."
  arg_type = String
  default = "nothing"
"--CV_query"
  help = "If for selection, folder name where Query files stored. If for ranking, single query file name for use to label patients"
  arg_type = String
"--top_net"
  help = "This keyword is used for ranking, it should be file containing selected networks name."
  arg_type = String
  default = "nothing"
"--smooth"
  help = "smooth the net or not"
  arg_type = Bool
  default = true
"--res_dir"
  help = "where to put the result"
  arg_type = String
"--cut_off"
  help = "cut_off to select top ranked network in network integration"
  arg_type = Int
  default = 9
```
   
**Outputs**:

For selection

1. `networks_weights_with_name.txt`: Txt file mapping networks name to its weights.
2. `mashup_tally.txt`: Txt file mapping networks name to its tally.
3. `top_networks.txt`: Txt file containing selected networks after cross validation.
4. `networks_index.txt`: Txt file mapping networks name to its internal id.
5. `cv_query.txt`: Txt file containing query internal id of each cross validation.
6. `beta.txt`: Txt file containing beta vector.
7. `networks_weights_each_cv.txt`: Txt file containing network weights of each cross validation.
8. `singular_value_sqrt.txt`: Txt file containing sqrt of singular value.

For ranking

1. `xxx_mashup_PRANK.txt`: Txt file mapping patients name to their weights.
2. `xxx_mashup_NRANK.txt`: Txt file mapping networks name to its weights.

         

### Example 
 
#### Usage 1: Mashup Feature Selection
 
First ensure that you have ModMashup.jl correctly installed in your computer.

```bash
$ var=$(julia -e "println(Pkg.dir())")
$ var="$var/ModMashup/test/data"
$ cd $var
$ mkdir temp_res
$ julia ../../tools/mashup.jl selection --net networks --id ids.txt --labels target.txt --CV_query . --smooth true --res_dir temp_res
```

The result will be saved at `temp_res` folder.

#### Usage 2: Mashup query runner for patients ranking using selected networks

After feature selection, you can run the command below to get patients ranking.

```bash
$ julia ../../tools/mashup.jl ranking --top_net temp_res/smooth_result/top_networks.txt --net networks --id ids.txt --CV_query CV_1.query --smooth true --res_dir temp_res
```

The result will be saved at `temp_res` folder.


## Experiment

### Input

Mashup and GeneMANIA example shared same input.

- TCGA Breast cancer dataset. Information used was patient ID and whether tumour is of subtype ‘Luminal A’ (LumA) or other.
- N=348 patients with 232 as traning samples. Classes={LumA, other} annotation. 
- Similarity nets defined at the level of pathways, using Pearson correlation (ProfileToNetworkDriver) as similarity. Generates 1801 networks.

### Result 

**Attention: Test needs to be repeated and the conclusion needs to be confirmed after changing the call to makePSN_NamedMatrix(), with writeProfiles=TRUE, I only test `_con.txt` file as currently ModMashup.jl only support that kind of format and so I have not make a experiment with `.profile`**
 
* This implementation in Julia is 50x faster(90 s ) than Java's implementation(4500 s) while achieving same and even better accuracy than raw GeneMANIA.

**Figure 2**: networks tally from GeneMANIA versus those from ModMashup for other type.


#### Relation between networks weight obtained from GeneMANIA and ModMashup

I have made two experiments to acquire network weight.

1. Correlation between H_cur and beta.

2. Dot product between H_cur and beta.
