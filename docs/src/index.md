# ModMashup.jl

## Project Goal and Motivations

The aim of the project is to Reimplement GeneMANIA in Julia to optimize netDx for high-performance computing. 

## Why called ModMashup?

Because the implementation of GeneMANIA in this package is different. We get intuitive from [mashup]() to replace linear regression part of GeneMANIA for high-performance computing. In short, mashup learns patient embedding and we use this information to derivate network weights.
