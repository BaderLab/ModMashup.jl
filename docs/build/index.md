## What is netDx?


netDx is a versatile patient classifier algorithm that integrates heterogeneous input data types (e.g. clinical and genomic) and uses machine-learning to identify features predictive of patient class. 


netDx models input data as patient networks and uses the GeneMANIA machine learning algorithm for network integration and feature selection. Patient classes can be any category of biomedical interest, including disease subtypes, responsiveness to medication, or disease outcome.
